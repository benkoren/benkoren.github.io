This piece was written for my wife as an encouragement for her to write more. Even if at first it reads like shit, if you dig deep enough I’m sure you’ll find something.


## 10 Gallons of Poo
### And the Value of Reflection


A jarring vibration emits from my pants, accompanied by a loud “DING!” Someone wants attention: an email, maybe, or perhaps I was just Facebook-tagged in a photo of our children. I’m not sure what the cause for interruption is, nor can I immediately check, for fear I may further sully the cleanliness of my phone – I continue scooping dog poo into a bucket.

Over the course of an entire winter the rear of our house has been peppered with dog poo, the bulk of which is concentrated outside the immediate viewing area of the only bay window. It now being the following spring, I alone am tasked with reconciling with the excremental debt I’ve incurred.

Then it hit me: the realization; the epiphany; the new perspective on what was puzzling me only moments before. The specific thought doesn’t matter as much as the value it had for me in that moment and the circumstances which made it possible. Suddenly I wasn’t scraping shit from the sad, brown grass. No, I was assembling the outline of a speech, drawing meaningful conclusions from recent experiences, figuring out who I am.

Some of my most profound and impactful thoughts have come at unexpected times: during long, hot showers; lying hopelessly alert in bed in the dead of the night after having been forced awake to relieve myself; cleaning up the fecal hoard the dogs had accumulated.

I used to laugh at the idea of an adult coloring book – and still do, if I’m being honest – but what does it matter how someone gets into a state of concentrated reflection? Go for a walk, knit a scarf, plant some hours, stare at a fire; I don’t care what it takes. Get comfortable with yourself. 
Amidst the sea of information that constantly bombards us, it is crucial that we step back and reflect if we expect to take any meaningful action in our lives.

Don’t be afraid to be with your own thoughts. It may seem lonely at first, but eventually you’ll soon come to some significant realization, a better understanding of yourself or, if you’re lucky, epiphany.
