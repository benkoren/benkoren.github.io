Over the last couple years, the public has turned its eye more and more toward security and privacy. Between the [data breaches][data-breaches] and abuses of user privacy, not to mention the more insidious ways that we are being [manipulated through technology][phychological-war]. Furthermore, our own US government is working hard to permanently catalog [all][jewel] [the][prism] [data][clearview] it can about us. 

Widespread public attention on all of this is a very, very good thing.

But what can the average user do about this? Quite a bit, it turns out. 

Free software is always free for a reason. It is important that we find out that reason, along with what may be given up in exchange for that software, most commonly either our attention for ads or our personal data. In other words, it's important to find out whether **you are the product**. That being said, there are some good companies out there that prioritize privacy and use the for-profit arm of their company to provide free (limited) services that offer that same level of privacy. 


## Email

When it comes to all big free email providers, such as Gmail, you are mostcertainly the product. However, good alternatives exist, such as [Protonmail][protonmail] and [Tutanota][tutanota].
