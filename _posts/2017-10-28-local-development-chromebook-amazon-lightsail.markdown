Today we'll explore how I use a [$170 Chromebook][chromebook], [vim][vim], and [Amazon Lightsail][lightsail] to do PHP and Ruby on Rails development.

## Background
I purchased a Chromebook about a year ago for our family's casual computing needs such as web browsing and Google Docs from the comfort of our couch _without_ the sweaty lap that comes from the use of a traditional laptop (or the pricetag!), while still having a standard-sized keyboard. Most importantly, it required absolutely minimal technical effort on my part, even if one of our kids tosses it into the bathtub; we could simply have another unit shipped for a reasonable price, log in, and pick up right where we had left off (after dealing with the bathtub incident, of course). 

Then I decided I'd like this same level of convenience for my work life as a software engineer: I wanted to web development from my Chromebook, but with the following requirements:
* *Language-agnostic*: I need a reasonable setup for developing PHP, Ruby on Rails, and open to others as well. The solution cannot be language-specific, though I have no immediate interest in the Microsoft languages.
* *Bathtub test*: if the device is destroyed, I need to be able to pick up where I had left off with minimal effort.
* *Debugging*: I need to be able to debug code, and none of this `var_dump()` nonsense. We're professionals, not savages.
* *Pricetag*: The solution needs to be reasonably priced, if not free. I'd prefer to spend some time upfront tinkering and working out a clever setup than to shell out money for a sub-optimal pre-packaged setup, but I need to spend a little cash then so be it.
* *Comfy factor*: No list of requirements is complete without a subjective, immeasurable requirement: this needs to _feel_ like a comfy development environment. Yes, I'll only have a single screen that has comparatively low resolution to my dedicated office complete with a mouse, external monitors, and a sound system.

## Downsides

Bonus points go to a solution that works offline and that does not degrade as network latency increases.
