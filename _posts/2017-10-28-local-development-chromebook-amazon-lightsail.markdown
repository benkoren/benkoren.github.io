Today we'll explore how I use a [$170 Chromebook][chromebook], vim, and Amazon Lightsail 

I purchased a Chromebook about a year ago for our family's casual computing needs such as web browsing and Google Docs from the comfort of our couch _without_ the sweaty lap that comes from the use of a traditional laptop (or the pricetag!), while still having a full-sized keyboard. Most importantly, it required absolutely minimal technical effort on my part, even if one of our kids tosses it into the bathtub; we could simply have another unit shipped for a reasonable price, log in, and pick up right where we had left off (after dealing with the bathtub incident, of course). 

Then I decided I'd like this same level of convenience for my work life as a software engineer: I wanted to web development from my Chromebook, but with the following requirements:
* A reasonable IDE for developing PHP, Ruby on Rails, and open to others as well - the solution cannot be language-specific.
* 







Bonus points go to a solution that works offline and that does not degrade as network latency increases.
