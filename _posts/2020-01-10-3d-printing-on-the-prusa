I started playing Minecraft about 5 years after it wasn't new and cool any more, so my timing with the 3d printer seems about right.

At the end of 2019, I purchased a [Prusa i3 MK3s][https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3/] 3D printer. I had previously regarded them as somewhat of a gimmick, at least for the consumer-grade versions, whose primary purpose was to pump out flimsy plastic trickets that would quickly make their way into a landfil. However, I've changed my tune for two reasons: working with electronics is far more fun when we can design the things they mount to, and the strength of the plastics able to be printed is impressive.

3d printing is a great way to satisfy my itch for mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and general tinkering. Wood and metalworking will always have a place for me, but the speed at which I can fabricate inexpensive yet strong parts on the 3d printer is what sets it apart. The technology is far from turn-key, so hopefully I can shed some light on things that took a good deal of time for me to get right. 


## Why a Prusa?

Prusa printers are relatively expensive, but they're of a very high quality for the price. More than that though, the company is one I feel I can get behind: they have very humble beginnings as a passion project for a young Josef Prusa, and from what I can tell they have been building an honest business, creating many jobs for their local citizens. [This video][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX3pDDi9PeU] showcases their history. They also do their fair share of supporting the maker community.

I purchased the kit version of the i3 MK3s and took a half day to assemble it, which I do recommend over purchasing the pre-assembled version; the process got me acquainted with the construction (and maintenance) of the printer. 


## Getting Started

I've long maintained that one of the most valuable skills a person can have is that of how to learn. To help accelerate this, here are some resources that greatly helped me along the way:

### Filament Choice

**Pick a filament and a vendor and stick with them**, at least until we're getting good, consistent results across a variety of prints. When I first started printing I was a bit overwhelmed with all the different filament types and ordered up 4 different types. However, this greatly slowed me down because I didn't get the hang of one type before I switched to another. I highly recommend [PETG][https://www.matterhackers.com/store/c/mh-build-series-petg], which deserves its reputation as being almost as easy to print as PLA and almost as strong as ABS - the best of both worlds. Every manufacturer's filament is different, 


### Calibration Prints

After powering on a printer for the first time, it can be tempting to jump right into printing elaborate, eye-pleasing models. However, a lot of time and heartache will be saved by first properly calibrating the printer. There are many variables, but the most important ones are bed preparation, first layer height, bed temperature, nozzle temperature, ambient temperature, and print speeds. 

#### Bed Preparation

The Prusa uses a heated PEI print surface, which plastic loves to stick to, so really all we need to do is keep it clean. There is a lot of information out there about using a glue stick, blue painter's tape, PVA glue, and others, but none of these are necessary with Prusa's print sheets. I've tried the Prusa's [Textured Sheet][https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/mk3mk3s/214-powder-coated-spring-steel-sheet.html], but could not get PETG to adhere well to it. I get much better adhesion on the [Smooth Sheet][https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/mk3mk3s/216-spring-steel-sheet-smooth-pei.html].

#### First Layer Height

The first layer of a print is extremely important; if it doesn't go down well, the print should be cancelled and it should be addressed. However, the first layer calibration built into the Prusa isn't very helpful.

### Slicer Profiles

The slicer is the software Managing all the settings for printing can be daunting, but making use of slicer profiles.
